# Cost-Efficient-Blockchain-framework-for-Trustworthy-IOT-Software-Updates

## Overview: 
This project presents a lightweight, secure, and cost-effective blockchain-based framework tailored for IoT ecosystems. It addresses the critical challenge of delivering authenticated software updates to resource-constrained devices without relying on centralized authorities.
By integrating smart contracts, IPFS, and cryptographic hashing, the framework ensures:
- Tamper-proof update validation
- Decentralized firmware distribution
- Scalable performance across thousands of devices
Ideal for smart cities, industrial IoT, and edge computing environments where trust and efficiency are paramount.

## Core Features
-  Blockchain-backed update verification via smart contracts
-  IPFS-based decentralized firmware storage
-  Lightweight cryptographic hashing for IoT compatibility
-  Secure update delivery with rollback protection
-  Cost-efficient consensus using Proof-of-Authority (PoA)

## How It Works
1. IoT device sends update request to Flask API.
2. API checks firmware hash stored on IPFS.
3. Smart contract verifies authenticity and logs the update.
4. Device downloads verified firmware from IPFS.
5. Update status is recorded on-chain for auditability.

## Results
-  40% reduction in update delivery cost vs. traditional PKI
-  99.9% update integrity across testbed simulations
-  Scalable to 10,000+ devices with minimal latency
